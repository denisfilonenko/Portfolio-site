					<h3>Greetings! My name is Denis.</h3>
					<p>I've been doing front-end development for over two years. Ð¡ommercial experience - over a year.</p><p> Currently I work at <a href="https://www.softlogic.com.ua/" target="_blank">SoftLogic</a>. My main commercial project while working in the company is the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.taxiua.app" target="_blank">Taxi UA</a> mobile application. All the client side and the logic of the application was developed and written by me, using the Vue.js framework and the Apache Cordova mobile development environment. Also, I have written several web modules for integration into mobile applications of taxi services.</p>
					<p>Before joining the company, I was engaged in intensive self-training for about a year. Also, during this time I finished courses on front-end development at <a href="https://itstep.org/" target="_blank">STEP Computer Academy</a>. I have great interest in this area and I am constantly trying to develop my skills and learn new technologies in my free time.</p>
